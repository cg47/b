Random stuff I write when I'm bored, typically to test random different things to learn the bounds.

Maybe somebody will find use to something I have around here, doubt it, but whatever.
Maybe somebody will tweak some of the code and find a good use of it and learn a thing or two.
Hope whatever I post helps a n00b like myself out.
